- 👋 Hi, I’m @reandrade01.  At least that is my username.  I normally go by Ronny.
- 👀 I’m interested in stepping out of the traditional BIG Tech methods of handling data through ETL and find revolutionizing strategies and solutions that can continue being developed on to deliver faster and lower cost streaming solutions that are affordable and widely used.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript, GraphQL, and REST.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on teaching how legacy ETL and BIG tech has developed on large middleware to help find more accessible, lower cost and better performing issues that will allow small business to succeed. 
- 📫 How to reach me ?  You can reach me at reandrade01@yahoo.com.  I still like sticking to some retro e-mail domains like Yahoo.  Like to preserve the classics. I can also be directly messaged through LinkedIn.  My direct profile is linkedin.com/in/ronnyandrade.  Say Hi!
